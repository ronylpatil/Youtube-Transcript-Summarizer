Deep learning is a subset of machine learning and artificial intelligence. It's a type of machine-learning inspired by the structure of the human brain. Machine-learning is a technique that enables a machine to mimic human behavior. In terms of deep learning, this structure is called an artificial neural network. Let's understand deep learning better and how it's different from machine learning. Deep learning is the most efficient way to deal with unstructured data, but a neural network requires a massive volume of data to train. The one neuron activated in the output layer corresponds to the input digit. Deep neural networks take hours or even months to train and training time increases with the amount of data. Replicating the human mind at the entirety may be not just an episode of science fiction for too long. The future is indeed full of surprises. If you enjoyed this video, do like and share it.
